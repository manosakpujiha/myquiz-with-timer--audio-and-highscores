# myquiz-with-timer--audio-and-highscores
Vanilla Javascript quiz app with contra theme sounds which connects to an API to retrieve questions and stores high scores using local storage. 


Please refresh the page after it loads for the first time so that the page syncs with the fetch questions requests, I am yet to fix that bug.
