# myquiz-with-timer--audio-and-highscores

Note: Please refresh the page after it loads for the first time so that the page syncs with the fetch questions requests, I am yet to fix that bug.

Vanilla Javascript quiz app with contra theme sounds which connects to an API to retrieve questions and stores high scores using local storage. 
This is a quiz app built with HTML, CSS & Javascript. It gets the questions data from an API using a fetch function, then stores the response to local storage. The questions are then retrieved from local storage and displayed on the page using a seris of createElement requests. It also makes use of the audio element to play various sounds during play. The app also stores all the highscores at the end of the game to local storage.
